Simple Linear Regression : Salary Data

In this machine learning project, I employed a simple linear regression model to predict individuals' salaries based on their years of experience. To ensure the model's reliability, I utilized the k-fold cross-validation technique, which partitions the data into k subsets and iteratively trains and tests the model on different combinations of these subsets.

After training and testing the model, I assessed its performance using several key metrics. The R-Squared value indicates the proportion of the variance in the salary that can be explained by the years of experience. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average difference between the predicted and actual salary values. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) represents the average percentage difference between the predicted and actual salaries. Lastly, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) calculates the standard deviation of the model's prediction errors.

These performance metrics provide valuable insights into how well the simple linear regression model performs in predicting salaries based on years of experience. By analyzing these metrics, we can evaluate the accuracy and precision of the model's predictions and make informed decisions about its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
